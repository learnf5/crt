NGINX Certificate Management Prep Course Labs

unlike other NGINX courses that each have their own github repo with folders Lab1, Lab2...
for the 4 cert prep labs we've decided to have 4 folders with the names of the Certification Exam name and use that for any files the lab will use

Exam 1 Management (conceptual information) 
Exam 2 Configuration Knowledge
Exam 3 Configuration Demonstrate
Exam 4 Troubleshooting
